# Social_Network_Analysis

In this project I will generate and analyzing three social networks (also known as graphs or sociograms) based on three different measures. I will be using data from:

Representing Classroom Social Structure. Melbourne: Victoria Institute of Secondary Education, M. Vickers and S. Chan, (1981)

Available from the Index of Complex Networks ([ICON](https://icon.colorado.edu/#!/))

The data were collected by Vickers & Chan from 29 seventh grade students in a school in Victoria, Australia. Students were asked to nominate their classmates on a number of relations including the following three "layers":  

1. Who do you get on with in the class?  
2. Who are your best friends in the class?  
3. Who would you prefer to work with?  

There is a dataset for each of these questions.

#### Data Wrangling

Manipulate each of the data sets so that it is suitable for building a social network using iGraph.


#### Visualize the Networks

Create a graph for each of the data sets. Visualize each of the graphs and color the nodes according to gender. Save pdfs of the graphs in this directory for upload to Github.

#### Centrality Measures

Who in the class has the highest degree centrality for each measure?

![centrality](https://github.com/ab4499/Social_Network/blob/master/graphs/centrality.png "github")

In friend dataset, the 8th student has the highest degree centrality 1.
In getOn dataset, the 11th student has the highest degree centrality 1.
In workWith dataset, the 14th student has the highest degree centrality 1.
